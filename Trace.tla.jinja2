VARIABLE i \* the trace index

\* "Reading" a record is just vars = Trace[i], but unfortunately TLC isn’t happy
\* with that, so:
Read == LET Rec == Trace[i]
        IN
{% for field in system_state_fields %}
           /\ {{ field }} = Rec[{{ loop.index }}]
{% endfor %}

\* Unfortunately, TLC also isn’t happy with just Read' – which is equivalent to:
ReadNext == LET Rec == Trace[i']
            IN
{% for field in system_state_fields %}
               /\ {{ field }}' = Rec[{{ loop.index }}]
{% endfor %}

Init == i = 1 /\ Read
Next == \/ i < Len(Trace) /\ i' = i + 1 /\ ReadNext
        \/ UNCHANGED <<i, vars>> \* So that we don’t get a deadlock error in TLC

TraceBehavior == Init /\ [][Next]_<<vars, i>>

\* Because we’re dealing with a finite trace, we only care about safety
\* properties, as liveness concerns only infinite behaviors.
\* TODO: Requires a property named "Safety" in spec? Explain in the paper.
\* TODO: What does this line accomplish? I find adding TraceBehavior to TLA+
\*   Toolbox "Properties" does nothing, but adding Model!Safety works.
THEOREM TraceBehavior => Model!Safety

\* To verify, we check the spec TraceBehavior in TLC , with Model!Safety as a
\* temporal property. As we’re always wary of success, we modify the above trace
\* to ensure that TLC finds an error.
